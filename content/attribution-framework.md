## How to Use These Metrics

**In Portfolio Case Studies:**
- Lead with the biggest number ($52.5MM)
- Provide context ("From 1,100 to 32,165 prospects")
- Show the system ("AI-led BDR pod with 2-hour SLA")
- Attribute correctly ("I architected... team executed...")

**In Interviews:**
- "I built revenue infrastructure that generated $52.5MM in net new revenue"
- "We improved data quality by 400% by implementing governance frameworks I designed"
- "The AI tools I created saved our team 24.5 hours per week"

**On LinkedIn:**
- Single metrics with visual proof
- "32,165 net new prospects. +2,821%. This is what happens when you treat marketing as revenue infrastructure, not a cost center."

## Meta-Learning: Attribution Framework

**The confusion that often happens:**
- LLMs read "TSI collected $XM in debt" and think Connor did that
- They miss that Connor marketed TSI's service
- They don't see that Connor BUILT the marketing infrastructure

**The correction:**
- What TSI did: Debt recovery, RCM services, client outcomes
- What Connor did: Made TSI discoverable, measurable, and positioned to win
- The overlap: Marketing communicated TSI's value, but didn't create it

**This distinction is CRITICAL for VP-level storytelling.**
