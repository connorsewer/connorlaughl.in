# Case Study: BDR Pod & Lead Generation Program

## Building a Signal-Based Outbound Engine from Zero

**Role:** VP of Marketing (acting CMO)  
**Timeline:** 90-day pilot (2024)  
**Team Size:** 2 BDRs (repurposed from telesales) + 1 Manager + Sales Ops support  
**Challenge:** Zero proactive lead generation, reactive inbound-only model, underutilized telesales capacity

---

## The Challenge

TSI's growth had always been inbound — referrals, RFPs, brand recognition from 40+ years in ARM. But the market was shifting:

- **Competitors** were building proactive outbound engines
- **Website signals** (ZoomInfo WebSights) showed 200+ high-intent visitors monthly with zero follow-up
- **Telesales reps** were underutilized, spending time on low-value activities
- **Sales team** wanted more first meetings but had no systematic prospecting support

The CEO asked: "Can we build a lead generation capability without hiring externally?"

The stakes: Miss the shift to proactive GTM and watch competitors capture the high-intent accounts already visiting our site.

## The Solution

### Team Building: Repurpose, Don't Hire

I identified two telesales reps with the right profile — hungry, coachable, tired of low-impact work — and proposed a 90-day pilot:

**Ethan Goldsmith** — High energy, competitive, wanted to prove himself in sales  
**Cynthia Acuna** — Detail-oriented, process-driven, strong phone presence

I worked with their manager to carve out 100% of their time for the BDR pilot and secured Sales Ops support for Salesforce configuration.

### The Operating Model (What I Built)

#### 1. BDR Operating Model (Complete 90-Day Plan)
- **Team structure:** Manager + 2 BDRs + Sales Ops support
- **Daily cadence:** 6 time blocks from 8:30 AM — 4:00 PM
  - 8:30-9:00: Signal review + prioritization
  - 9:00-10:30: Power hour (calls + emails)
  - 10:30-12:00: Research + sequence building
  - 12:00-1:00: Lunch + admin
  - 1:00-3:00: Calls + follow-ups
  - 3:00-4:00: Planning + Salesforce hygiene

#### 2. KPI Framework (What Gets Measured)
| Metric | Target | Why It Mattered |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Weekly meetings | 3-5 per BDR | Leading indicator of pipeline |
| Daily dials | 250-300 | Activity baseline |
| New contacts/week | 80-120 | List building velocity |
| Sequences started/week | 60-80 | Outreach volume |
| Held meeting → SQL | 30-40% | Quality filter |
| Tier-A signal SLA | 100% (<2 hours) | Speed-to-lead advantage |

#### 3. Signal-to-Meeting Workflow
- **ZoomInfo WebSights** → Daily signal report
- **Tier-A accounts** (top 250 Healthcare, DebtNext install base) → 2-hour touch SLA
- **Tier-B accounts** (utilities, tolling) → 24-hour touch SLA
- **Tier-C accounts** (all others) → 48-hour touch SLA

#### 4. Training & Enablement (What I Taught Them)

**Week 1:** Bootcamp
- Day 1: TSI value props, ICP profiles, competitive landscape
- Day 2: ZoomInfo training, Salesforce workflows, WebSights dashboard
- Day 3: Call scripts, email templates, objection handling
- Day 4: Live call listening, shadowing AEs
- Day 5: Practice calls, sequence building, Q&A

**Week 2-4:** Daily coaching
- Morning huddles (15 min): Priorities, blockers, wins
- Live call listening (Tue/Thu): Real-time feedback
- Email reviews (Wed): Template customization guidance
- End-of-week debrief: Metrics review, skill building

**Ongoing:**
- Bi-weekly 1:1s with each BDR
- Monthly calibration sessions with sales leadership
- Quarterly playbook updates based on what's working

#### 5. Outbound Messaging Kits (What They Used)

**Email Templates:**
- DebtNext → ARM cross-sell (85-110 words)
- Healthcare RCM denials automation (value-focused)
- Digital/AI collections enterprise (productivity angle)

**Call Scripts:**
- 30-second opener (hook + value prop + ask)
- 11-14 second voicemail (callback driver)
- 5-touch sequence framework (10 business days)

### The Framework (What They Followed)

I documented everything in a **BDR Playbook** — 40+ pages covering:
- ICP definitions by vertical
- Lead routing logic
- Salesforce field requirements (Intent Tier, Last Sequence Day)
- Discovery Brief template for AE handoffs
- Compliance brief (call windows, DNC, opt-outs)

---

## The Outcome

### Meeting Generation
- **40-60 first meetings** in 90 days (vs. 0 baseline)
- **12-20 SQLs** generated (30-40% conversion)
- **100% Tier-A signal SLA** maintained (<2 hour response)

### Team Development
- **2 BDRs trained** from telesales to lead generation specialists
- **Both BDRs retained** and became top performers in the pod
- **Playbook created** for scaling to additional BDRs

### Pipeline Impact
- **$2.5M+ pipeline** created from BDR-sourced meetings
- **3 closed-won deals** in pilot period (DebtNext cross-sell)
- **Template for scale:** Proved the model before expanding headcount

> **📊 KEY STAT:** 3-5 weekly meetings per BDR from a standing start — built without external hires, using repurposed talent and systematic enablement.

## Leadership Angle: Team Building from Scratch

This wasn't about managing existing talent. It was about:

### Identifying Potential
I hand-picked Ethan and Cynthia based on:
- Hunger for growth (not just doing the job)
- Coachability (willing to be trained)
- Resilience (handling rejection without quitting)

### Building the System
I didn't just say "make calls." I built:
- Daily schedules with time blocks
- KPI dashboards with leading indicators
- Training curriculum with skill progression
- Quality assurance with live feedback

### Creating the Culture
- **Competitive but collaborative:** BDRs shared wins and tactics
- **Metric-transparent:** Daily scorecards, no hiding
- **Quality-focused:** Not just dials, but quality conversations

## What Made This Work

**Repurposing Over Hiring:** Proved the model with existing talent before asking for budget.

**Systematic Enablement:** Training wasn't "figure it out" — it was structured, measured, and iterated.

**Signal-Based Prioritization:** WebSights data meant BDRs called accounts already researching TSI, not cold lists.

**Speed-to-Lead:** The 2-hour Tier-A SLA meant we caught prospects while they were still in research mode.
