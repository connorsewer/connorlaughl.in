## Questions for Clarification

### Metrics to Confirm
1. BDR program: Did Connor personally generate $2.5M pipeline or is that the team's result?
2. DebtNext integration: Are the CAC reduction and NRR numbers directly attributable to Connor's GTM design?
3. Messaging: Was the 10% payment lift measured?
