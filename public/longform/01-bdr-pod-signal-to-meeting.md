# BDR Pod: Signal-to-Meeting in 2 Hours

## The Problem

TSI had telesales reps making dials. No intent signals. No prioritization logic. No SLA between a website visit and an outbound touch. Marketing generated traffic; sales worked a static list. The gap between interest and contact was measured in days — if it was measured at all.

## What I Built

Repurposed existing telesales headcount into a dedicated 2-person BDR pod (Ethan & Cynthia). Designed the operating system from scratch:

- **Signal source:** ZoomInfo WebSights daily exports identifying B2B companies visiting TSI properties
- **Enrichment layer:** Company match → ICP score → contact append — all before a human touches it
- **2-hour SLA:** From signal identification to first outbound touch. Not a target. A rule.
- **DebtNext cross-sell motion:** Parallel track targeting existing DebtNext accounts for TSI upsell — warm pipeline from day one
- **Weekly review cadence:** Signal quality, conversion rates, disqualification patterns — iterating the machine weekly

## The Numbers

| Metric | Target (First 90 Days) |
|---|---|
| Meetings booked | 40–60 |
| SQLs generated | 12–20 |
| Signal-to-touch SLA | ≤ 2 hours |
| Weekly review cadence | Every Friday |

## Why This Matters at the VP+ Level

This isn't a "we hired SDRs" story. This is a resource reallocation play — no new headcount, no new budget. Took existing telesales capacity, added an intent signal layer, imposed operational discipline, and turned a cost center into a pipeline engine.

The governance piece is what separates it: documented workflows, SLAs with teeth, weekly iteration loops. Most BDR pods die from neglect. This one was designed to self-correct.

## Interview Anchor

> "I didn't ask for new headcount. I repurposed existing telesales into a signal-driven BDR pod with a 2-hour SLA. First 90 days: targeting 40-60 meetings and 12-20 SQLs. The unlock was governance — weekly reviews, documented workflows, and a cross-sell motion into an existing install base."
