# Two-Function Marketing: Org Design as Operating System

## The Problem

Marketing had no structural clarity.

- Demand gen, enablement, content, design, and brand lived in one blob
- Requests arrived via Slack/email/hallway—no intake, no tracking
- No SLAs, no cadence, no predictability

When marketing has no operating system, it becomes an unbounded service desk.

## Constraints

- Needed **clear lanes** (pipeline vs. enablement)
- Needed **throughput + governance** (not just an org chart)

## What I Built

I restructured marketing into two accountable functions and added a governance layer that controlled how work moved.

### Function 1: Demand Generation

- Campaigns, account-based marketing (ABM), funnel analytics, BDR pod oversight
- Owns pipeline metrics: meetings, SQLs, conversion rates
- Weekly operating review with sales leadership

### Function 2: Sales Enablement & Design

- Collateral factory, pitch library, case studies, RFP support
- Owns output cadence + quality SLAs
- Intake-to-archive workflow via a centralized Marketing Hub (SharePoint/Teams)

### The Governance Layer

Most org redesigns fail because the boxes change but the work doesn’t. I built the system:

- **Brief-to-Ship SLA (7 days):** Day 0 brief → Day 1 outline → Day 2 draft → Day 3 review → Days 4–5 build/ship (no “rush jobs” that blow up the queue)
- **Published output minimums:** 26 press releases/year; 4+ weekly line-of-business (LOB)-specific content posts (~200+/year); 1 new sales asset/week
- **Beautiful.ai governance:** Centralized deck management (version control, brand compliance, no rogue PowerPoints)
- **Monthly product-marketing alignment:** Formal cadence between DebtNext and TSI marketing
- **GA4 audience segregation:** B2B vs. Consumer/Debtor filtering so reporting wasn’t polluted by consumer traffic

## The Numbers

| Output | Cadence |
|---|---|
| Press releases | 26/year |
| Content posts (line-of-business / LOB-specific) | 4+/week |
| New sales assets | 1/week |
| Brief-to-Ship SLA | 7 days max |
| Cross-team alignment | Monthly |

## Why This Matters at the VP+ Level

Org design is strategy made executable.

This structure made marketing operate like a product team: defined inputs, measurable outputs, predictable throughput. And GA4 governance solved a credibility problem most teams never fix—separating real B2B demand signals from high-volume consumer noise.

## Interview Anchor

> "I restructured marketing into two functions—Demand Gen and Sales Enablement—with a 7-day Brief-to-Ship SLA, published output minimums, and strict GA4 audience segregation. Marketing stopped being a service desk and started operating like a product team."
