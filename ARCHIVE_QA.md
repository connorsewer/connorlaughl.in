# ARCHIVE_QA — Portfolio v2 Copy Checklist

Goal: operator-direct, proof-dense, public-safe.

## 1) Proof Density (no vibes)
- [ ] Every case study has **Outcome + System + Governance** (explicit labels or unmistakable sections).
- [ ] At least **3 quantified proof points** (%, $, days, counts) OR clearly marked ranges (public-safe).
- [ ] No orphan claims: every bold outcome has a “how” attached (system + process).
- [ ] Include **constraints** (budget, headcount, compliance, messy data) — makes wins believable.

## 2) Public-Safe Claims
- [ ] If a metric could be sensitive, use **ranges** (e.g., “~10%”, “20%+”, “weeks → days”).
- [ ] Avoid client-identifying specifics unless already public.
- [ ] No internal tool names that imply confidential data exposure.

## 3) Operator Voice (tight, not marketing)
- [ ] Prefer verbs like: **engineered, governed, instrumented, enforced, shipped, rebuilt**.
- [ ] Kill filler: “leveraged / optimized / drove / enhanced / world-class”.
- [ ] Short sentences. Concrete nouns. Minimal adjectives.

## 4) Structure Consistency
- [ ] Title reads like a system, not a slogan.
- [ ] Deck is 1–2 sentences max.
- [ ] Bullets are parallel and punchy (no multi-paragraph bullets).
- [ ] Add an **Interview Anchor** line that can be spoken verbatim.

## 5) Governance / Trust Layer
- [ ] Include at least one governance mechanism: **SLA, approval gate, taxonomy, version control, audit log, definitions/owners**.
- [ ] If compliance matters, name it (SOC2/PCI/HIPAA) only if accurate and public-safe.

## 6) Artifacts / Receipts
- [ ] Each case study lists 2–5 artifacts (docs, process maps, dashboards, specs) even if not linked publicly.
- [ ] If an artifact exists in Drive/local, note where (e.g., “Proof Library / Drive export”).

## 7) UX / Readability
- [ ] First screen communicates: **what changed + by how much**.
- [ ] No walls of text; add tables or short lists when dense.
- [ ] Avoid acronyms unless defined once.

## 8) Final Pass (credibility)
- [ ] Would a skeptical VP Sales believe this without a call?
- [ ] Could a recruiter skim it in 15 seconds and repeat it accurately?
