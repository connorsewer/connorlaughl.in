# Case Study: Healthcare RCM Denials Automation (PULSE/SAGA)

## Overview
Value proposition and messaging framework for TSI's Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management offering, focusing on PULSE/SAGA automation for claims denials and patient pay optimization.

## Key Metrics
- **Up to 26 days** faster appeal drafting (projected)
- **~47%** improvement in approval odds (projected)
- **$500** minimum viable claim size (expanded from typical $5K threshold)
- **95%+** CSAT on patient interactions
- **HIPAA-aligned** operations with BAAs and audit trails
- **~$460M** TSI 2025E revenue (company scale context)

## What Connor Built
- **Healthcare RCM Messaging Guide** (within Outcome-First Architecture):
  - Buyer personas: VP Revenue Cycle, PFS/Denials leaders, Compliance officers
  - Primary Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD):
    1. Automate payer follow-up & appeals scripting
    2. Shrink denials backlog; expand into low-balance segments
    3. Preserve patient experience and brand

- **Value Proposition Matrix**:
  | Outcome | How | Proof/KPI |
  |---------|-----|-----------|
  | Faster reimbursement | PULSE/SAGA automation | Up to 26 days faster |
  | More recoveries | Expand to $500 minimum claims | New recoverable inventory |
  | Patient-friendly experience | Self-service, flexible plans | CSAT/NPS |
  | Audit-ready | HIPAA controls, BAAs | Audit exceptions ↓ |

- **Feature → Benefit → Outcome → Evidence Chain** (8 items):
  1. SAGA/PULSE → automate follow-up → cycle-time ↓ → up to 26 days saved
  2. Payer-specific workflows → fewer touch-backs → approval rate ↑
  3. White-label patient outreach → brand protection → complaints ↓
  4. Self-service/flexible plans → easier to pay → patient cash ↑
  5. HIPAA-aligned operations → compliance assurance → audit readiness
  6. EHR/billing integrations → faster stand-up → time-to-value ↓
  7. Speech analytics → QA at scale → exceptions ↓
  8. DR/BC → service continuity → uninterrupted denials work

- **Copy Blocks**:
  - H1: "From denials to dollars"
  - H2: "Automate follow-up, cut cycle time, protect the patient experience"
  - Email subjects and body copy (3 email variants)
  - Paid social copy (4 variants)
  - Sales one-liners (4)
  - Discovery questions (4)

- **Objection Handling**:
  - "Our denials are unique" → Start with one payer to prove lift

- **Land-and-Expand Strategy**:
  - Start with one payer/denial type
  - Expand by payer or balance band
  - Add patient pay EBO after denials control

## What TSI Marketed
- **"Denials resolved in days, not months"** - Speed to reimbursement
- **"Appeals that actually stick"** - Approval rate improvement
- **"Expand viable claims down to $500"** - New recoverable inventory
- **"Patient-friendly. Audit-ready."** - Compliance + experience
- **"Preserve patient trust with white-label outreach"** - Brand protection

## Attribution Clarity
**Connor's Work:** Messaging architecture, value proposition matrix, feature-benefit-outcome chains, copy blocks, email sequences, objection handlers, land-and-expand playbook, discovery questions.

**TSI's Assets:** PULSE/SAGA automation technology, projected performance metrics (26 days, 47%), HIPAA compliance infrastructure, EHR/billing integrations, patient pay platform, actual client outcomes data (to be confirmed for external use).

## Strategic Impact
This messaging positioned TSI's Healthcare RCM offering around financial outcomes (faster reimbursement, higher approval rates) rather than just operational support. The $500 minimum claim expansion represented a significant market expansion — enabling providers to pursue previously unprofitable low-balance denials through automation.
