## What Connor Built
- **Self-Assessment Worksheet** with:
  - Scoring rubric (1-5) with clear behavioral definitions
  - 30+ KPIs organized by functional area
  - Gap identification framework (Low 1-2, Middle 3, High 4-5)
  - Action priority guidance

- **Diagnostic Insights** (from BDR Plan margin notes):
  - MQL/SQL process "slightly blurred" — needs redesign
  - Lead Source field not properly populated (most show "web")
  - Forecast alignment between Sales, Ops, Finance not yet achieved
  - Existing customer info not up-to-date in Salesforce
  - Some metrics not tracked (Talk Time, some Lead Gen dashboard items)

- **Improvement Roadmap Indicators**:
  - Low scoring (1-2) = Gaps that need to be built
  - Middle scoring (3) = Tracking but not using strategically
  - High scoring (4-5) = Double down or automate/report

## What TSI Assessed
- **Current State Maturity** - Honest evaluation of tracking capabilities
- **Process Gaps** - MQL/SQL definition inconsistencies, attribution problems
- **Data Quality Issues** - Lead source population, customer data hygiene
- **Alignment Challenges** - Forecast coordination across departments

## Attribution Clarity
**Connor's Work:** Self-assessment worksheet design, scoring rubric, KPI categorization, gap analysis framework, improvement priority guidance, diagnostic questions.

**TSI's Assets:** Current Salesforce/Pardot configuration, historical process evolution (documented in margin notes), stakeholder feedback on process gaps, operational pain points from BDR/Sales teams.

## Strategic Impact
This self-assessment provided a structured way to evaluate GTM operational maturity without external consulting. The scoring system created a common language for discussing capability gaps. The marginal notes revealed candid internal perspectives on process challenges that weren't visible in formal documentation — valuable context for prioritization.
