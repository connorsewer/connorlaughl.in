# GTM Consulting Outreach Sequence

## Cold Email Templates

### Template 1: Problem-Angle Cold Outreach

**Subject:** Quick question about [COMPANY]'s GTM

Hi [NAME],

I noticed [COMPANY] is [recent news/funding/hiring] — congrats on the momentum.

I'm curious: how's your lead gen and conversion looking these days? 

I ask because I've been helping B2B SaaS companies [specific result: "build AI-first GTM systems that cut CAC by 40%"] and wonder if you'd be open to a quick 15-min chat about what's working (and what isn't).

No pitch if it's not a fit — just curious if there's a match here.

Best,
Connor

Hi [NAME],

[MUTUAL] and I were talking, and they mentioned you're [role] at [COMPANY]. They thought we'd have good chemistry around GTM strategy.

I've spent [years] building revenue engines for B2B SaaS — from zero to [$X] pipeline at [past companies]. Recently, I've been helping companies [specific result].

Would be great to grab 15 minutes this week if you're open to it.

Best,

## Tips for Outreach

1. **Personalize each message** — Reference something specific about them
2. **Keep it short** — 4-6 sentences max
3. **Lead with value** — What can you give, not what do you want
4. **Follow up** — 80% of deals need 5+ touches
5. **Track everything** — Use a simple spreadsheet
