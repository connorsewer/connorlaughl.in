# Case Study: CX/BPO Repositioning Initiative

## Overview
Strategic initiative to transform TSI's CX/BPO messaging from conservative/operational to bold, value-driven positioning targeting millennial and Gen-Z enterprise buyers.

## Key Metrics
- **95%+** CSAT on escalated volume
- **<10%** agent attrition (vs. 30%+ industry average)
- **100%** AI QA coverage via Ripple
- **45%** onshore staffing (hybrid delivery model)
- **400%** AI uplift (referenced proof point)
- **$25M** AI margin impact (referenced proof point)

## What Connor Built
- **Strategic Repositioning Framework**:
  - Initiative outline with clear objective and strategic rationale
  - "Before → After" transformation map
  - 5 strategic shifts (operational features → outcome benefits, conservative tone → bold tone, etc.)

- **New Messaging Architecture**:
  - **Positioning Statement:** "TSI handles the calls your competitors can't. From energy outages to legal disputes, we deliver 95%+ CSAT on the calls that make or break your customer relationships."
  - **Tagline:** "High-Risk CX. Zero-Regret Outcomes."
  - **Headline Hook:** "You don't need more agents. You need fewer headlines."

- **"Radical Relevance" Messaging Principles**:
  1. Lead with Stakes, Not Specs
  2. Data as Punchline, Not Footnote
  3. Tone Shift: Less Vendor, More Vanguard

- **CX/BPO Pilot Messaging Drafts**:
  - Elevator pitch (bold & direct)
  - Landing page hero copy
  - Deck slide copy (What You Get / Why It Matters)
  - Before/After tone shift examples

- **Testing Strategy**:
  - Pilot campaign channels (Paid LinkedIn, microsite, email nurture)
  - Test variables (tone, hooks, CTA framing)
  - Success metrics (CTR, time-on-page, message recall, lead quality)

- **Expansion Plan**:
  - Scale to ARM, RCM, Loan Servicing lines
  - Sales enablement (decks, openers, talk tracks)
  - RFP and web content integration

- **Audit Recap** (Current State Analysis):
  - Strengths: Powerful proof points, platform names, compliance tone
  - Gaps: Visual boldness, emotional stakes, younger tone, product marketing flow

## What TSI Marketed
- **"High-Risk CX, without the high-risk outcomes"** - Brand protection focus
- **"95%+ CSAT on the hardest customer service calls in America"** - Data-driven proof
- **"AI-backed QA, multilingual agents, regulatory-grade compliance"** - Capability stack
- **"You don't need more agents. You need fewer headlines."** - Provocative hook

## Attribution Clarity
**Connor's Work:** Strategic initiative design, messaging architecture, positioning statement, tagline development, headline hooks, "Radical Relevance" framework, pilot messaging drafts, testing strategy, expansion roadmap, current state audit.

**TSI's Assets:** CSAT metrics (95%+), agent attrition data (<10% vs 30%+ industry), Ripple AI QA platform, hybrid delivery model infrastructure, proof points (400% AI uplift, $25M margin impact), CX delivery capabilities.

## Strategic Impact
This initiative positioned TSI's CX/BPO offering as differentiated from commodity contact centers. The "high-risk CX" framing targeted industries (utilities, healthcare, government) where compliance and brand protection are paramount. The bold messaging approach was designed to stand out with younger decision-makers who respond to data-driven, confident positioning over traditional corporate language.
