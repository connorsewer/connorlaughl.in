# Two-Function Marketing: Org Design as Operating System

## The Problem

TSI's marketing function had no structural clarity. Demand generation, sales enablement, content, design, and brand all lived in an undifferentiated blob. No lanes. No SLAs. No cadence. Requests came in through Slack, email, hallway conversations. Nothing was tracked. Nothing was predictable.

When marketing has no structure, it becomes a service desk that everyone complains about but nobody owns.

## What I Built

Restructured marketing into two clear, accountable functions:

### Function 1: Demand Generation
- Campaigns, ABM, funnel analytics, BDR pod oversight
- Owns pipeline metrics: meetings, SQLs, conversion rates
- Weekly operating review with sales leadership

### Function 2: Sales Enablement & Design
- Collateral factory, pitch library, case studies, RFP support
- Owns output cadence and quality SLAs
- Intake-to-archive workflow via centralized Marketing Hub (SharePoint/Teams)

### The Governance Layer

This is where most org redesigns fail — they draw new boxes but don't change how work moves. I built the operating system:

- **"Brief-to-Ship" SLA:** 7-day turnaround for any content asset. Day 0: Brief. Day 1: Outline. Day 2: Draft. Day 3: Review. Days 4-5: Build & Ship. No exceptions. No "rush jobs" that blow up the queue.
- **Output minimums:** 26 press releases/year. 4+ weekly content posts (LOB-specific). 1 new sales asset per week. Published, tracked, reported.
- **Beautiful.ai governance:** Centralized deck management — version control, brand compliance, no rogue PowerPoints.
- **Monthly cross-team alignment:** Formalized cadence between DebtNext and TSI Marketing for product-marketing sync.
- **GA4 audience segregation:** Implemented strict B2B vs. Consumer/Debtor filtering so lead-gen reporting wasn't polluted by consumer traffic. Clean data or no data.

## The Numbers

| Output | Cadence |
|---|---|
| Press releases | 26/year |
| Content posts (LOB-specific) | 4+/week |
| New sales assets | 1/week |
| Brief-to-Ship SLA | 7 days max |
| Cross-team alignment | Monthly |

## Why This Matters at the VP+ Level

Org design is strategy made visible. Most marketing leaders inherit a structure and optimize around it. I scrapped the structure and rebuilt it around two questions: "What drives pipeline?" and "What arms sellers?"

Everything else — governance, SLAs, cadences, tooling — flows from those two answers. The result is a marketing function that operates like a product team: defined inputs, measurable outputs, predictable throughput.

The GA4 governance piece alone is worth a conversation — most companies can't tell you which web traffic is B2B prospect activity vs. consumer noise. We solved that at the tracking layer, not the dashboard layer.

## Interview Anchor

> "I restructured marketing into two functions — Demand Gen and Sales Enablement — with a 7-day Brief-to-Ship SLA, published output minimums, and strict GA4 audience segregation. Marketing stopped being a service desk and started operating like a product team. 26 press releases a year, 4+ weekly content posts, 1 new sales asset per week — all tracked, all governed."
