## What TSI Marketed
- **Data-Driven Sales Operations** - Funnel visibility from lead to revenue
- **Predictable Revenue Model** - Conversion rates enabling accurate forecasting
- **Operational Excellence** - Dashboards for executive, marketing, and sales teams

## Attribution Clarity
**Connor's Work:** KPI definitions, formula documentation, lead lifecycle taxonomy, reverse funnel calculator methodology, dashboard specifications, self-assessment framework, strategic application guidance.

**TSI's Assets:** Salesforce CRM data, Pardot marketing automation, historical conversion data (for benchmarking), sales team feedback (documented in margin notes), operational infrastructure.

## Strategic Impact
This framework gave TSI's revenue leadership a common language for measuring GTM performance. The self-assessment worksheet revealed critical gaps (Lead Source Attribution poorly populated, Forecast Accuracy not tracked) while providing a roadmap for operational improvement. The reverse funnel calculator enabled accurate headcount and activity planning.
