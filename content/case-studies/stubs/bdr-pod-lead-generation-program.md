# Case Study: BDR Pod & Lead Generation Program

## Overview
Design and deployment of a 90-day, budget-light BDR (Business Development Representative) program repurposing two telesales reps into a focused lead generation pod targeting website signals and ABM outreach.

## Key Metrics
- **40-60** first meetings target (90 days)
- **12-20** SQLs target (90 days)
- **3-5** weekly meetings per BDR
- **250-300** daily dials per BDR
- **80-120** new contacts added weekly per BDR
- **60-80** new sequences started weekly per BDR
- **30-40%** held meeting to SQL conversion rate
- **100%** WebSights Tier-A touch SLA (within 2 hours)

## What Connor Built
- **Complete BDR Operating Model** (90-day plan):
  - Team structure (Manager + 2 BDRs + Sales Ops support)
  - Daily cadence schedule (6 blocks from 8:30 AM - 4:00 PM)
  - Weekly targets and KPI framework
  - ICP definitions and value hooks by vertical
  - Signal-to-meeting workflow (ZoomInfo WebSights)
  - ABM list strategy (3 target lists: DebtNext install base, Top 250 Healthcare, Utilities/Tolling)

- **Outbound Messaging Kits**:
  - DebtNext → ARM cross-sell email template
  - Healthcare RCM denials automation template
  - Digital/AI collections enterprise template
  - 30-second call opener script
  - 11-14 second voicemail script
  - 5-touch sequence framework (10 business days)

- **Operational Infrastructure**:
  - Salesforce field requirements (Intent Tier, Last Sequence Day)
  - Lead routing logic by vertical
  - Discovery Brief template for AE handoffs
  - Compliance brief (call windows, DNC, opt-outs)
  - QA schedule (Tue/Thu live-listen + email review)

- **Week-1 Task List** (10 implementation steps)

## What TSI Marketed
- **"DebtNext → ARM Cross-Sell"** - Fastest warm path to revenue
- **"Digital/AI Collections"** - Up to 15% productivity lift
- **"Healthcare Denials Automation"** - PULSE/SAGA pilots
- **"Website Signal Response"** - Real-time intent-based outreach

## Attribution Clarity
**Connor's Work:** Program design, operating model, workflow documentation, messaging templates, sequence frameworks, Salesforce configuration specs, training materials, KPI dashboards, compliance guardrails, implementation roadmap.

**TSI's Assets:** ZoomInfo WebSights tool, Salesforce CRM, existing telesales reps (Ethan Goldsmith, Cynthia Acuna), product capabilities (CollectX, MENSA, PULSE/SAGA), compliance infrastructure, client references.

## Strategic Impact
This program transformed TSI's lead generation from reactive (waiting for inbound) to proactive (signal-based ABM). The DebtNext cross-sell strategy leveraged existing software customers to open services conversations — creating a lower-friction entry point than cold outreach. The operating model was designed to run with minimal budget and existing headcount.
