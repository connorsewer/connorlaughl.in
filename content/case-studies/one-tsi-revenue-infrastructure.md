## What Made This Work

**Attribution Framework:**
- ✅ **Connor's Work:** Architecture, governance, strategy, AI systems, process design
- ✅ **Team Execution:** Content production, sales development, campaign deployment
- ✅ **Client Results:** TSI's service delivery (debt recovery, RCM) — marketed but not built by Connor

**Key Insight:** This wasn't just "marketing" — it was building revenue infrastructure that made TSI's services discoverable, measurable, and scalable.
