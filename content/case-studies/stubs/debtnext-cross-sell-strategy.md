# Case Study: DebtNext Cross-Sell Strategy

## Overview
Strategic framework for converting DebtNext software customers into TSI services clients (ARM, legal, BPO) through targeted cross-sell messaging and pilot programs.

## Key Metrics
- **1 pilot/month** goal for DebtNext → ARM cross-sell
- **90-day** carve-out pilot duration
- **5-10%** test placement rate for legal expansion
- **Quarterly** workshops with top install-base logos
- **Modeled meaningful upside** when ARM bundled with DebtNext (internal CIP data)

## What Connor Built
- **Cross-Sell Narrative Scripts** (within Outcome-First Architecture):
  - **DebtNext → ARM**: "You already see vendor yield in DebtNext. Let's move a slice to TSI's ARM and benchmark net-back. We'll keep your vendors and reporting as-is, run a carve-out for 90 days, and show you where routing rules should change."
  - **ARM → Portfolio Mgmt/Legal**: "Your top cohorts are saturating current vendors. We'll open a legal path for the small subset that merits it and use portfolio steering to keep your brand intact."

- **BDR Cross-Sell Messaging Kit**:
  - Subject: "Fast idea on getting more out of your DebtNext stack"
  - Body (85-110 words): Positioning ARM bundling with DebtNext for inventory penetration + liquidation lift
  - 30-second call opener incorporating cross-sell angle

- **Expansion Narrative Framework**:
  - Start with transparency ("You already see vendor yield")
  - Add execution ("Let's move a slice to TSI's ARM")
  - Keep options open ("If it underperforms, we switch it back")
  - Scale on proof ("If it outperforms, we scale it")
  - Decision clarity ("Your dashboards make the decision easy")

- **Pilot Structure**:
  - Duration: 90 days
  - Approach: Side-by-side carve-out
  - Comparison: Net-back vs. baseline
  - Flexibility: No vendor replacement required
  - Decision point: Routing rules based on performance data

- **Priority Play Ranking**:
  - #1: DebtNext → ARM cross-sell pilots (quarterly workshops)
  - #2: Healthcare denials automation
  - #3: Utilities & Tolling references

## What TSI Marketed
- **"Get more out of your DebtNext stack"** - Value expansion
- **"Benchmark net-back vs. baseline"** - Performance proof
- **"One platform to see, steer, and prove recovery performance"** - Integrated value
- **"Compare vendors on liquidation, costs, and exceptions"** - Transparency promise

## Attribution Clarity
**Connor's Work:** Cross-sell narrative scripts, BDR messaging templates, expansion narrative framework, pilot structure design, priority play ranking, email copy, call scripts.

**TSI's Assets:** DebtNext platform (recovery management software), existing DebtNext install base data, internal CIP (Client Insight Program) cross-sell uplift models, ARM services capabilities, vendor performance benchmarking data, legal network infrastructure.

## Strategic Impact
The DebtNext cross-sell strategy leveraged existing software relationships to open services conversations — a significantly lower-friction path than cold outreach. By positioning TSI ARM as a "test and compare" option rather than a replacement, the strategy reduced change risk for prospects while providing clear performance data for decision-making.
