# Advisory Engagements

**Headline:** Available for Advisory Engagements

**Tagline:** Strategic guidance for leadership teams navigating complex GTM decisions.

## Section 1: The Context

**Headline:** While I Seek My Next VP Role

I'm currently exploring VP of Marketing and GTM Systems leadership roles—ideally in Series B+ B2B environments where governance, instrumentation, and narrative discipline matter.

In parallel, I'm selectively advising companies on their GTM architecture. This keeps me sharp and connected to the market. It's advisory work, not a pivot to consulting. The goal is impact, not replacement income.

**If you're hiring for a VP GTM, VP Marketing Operations, or Chief of Staff (GTM) role, [let's talk](mailto:connor.laughlin@gmail.com).**

## Section 2: Where I Add Value

**Headline:** I Advise Leadership Teams On

### GTM Systems Architecture
Designing the integrated layer between marketing, sales, and data systems. From CRM governance to AI-native workflow orchestration, I help teams move from duct-taped integrations to intentional architecture.

**Key outcomes:** Reduced cycle times, higher data confidence, scalable automation with governance guardrails.

### Demand Generation Infrastructure
Building signal-driven pipeline engines—enrichment workflows, intent scoring, BDR pod design, and the operational discipline to hit SLAs. Not theory. Systems that ship.

**Key outcomes:** Predictable meeting flow, measurable SQL velocity, clear attribution without the fiction.

### Narrative & Positioning Strategy
Reframing company stories around customer outcomes, not product features. I've led repositioning work that drove 10%+ payment lifts and 20%+ cost reductions by changing how the market hears you.

**Key outcomes:** Differentiated positioning, sales confidence, messaging that survives procurement.

### Org Design & Operating Rhythm
Restructuring marketing and GTM teams into accountable functions with clear output standards. I've built systems with 7-day brief-to-ship SLAs and 200+/year content floors.

**Key outcomes:** Clear ownership, measurable output, cross-functional alignment without bureaucracy.

### BDR Pod: Signal-to-Meeting

**Outcome:** 40-60 meetings + 12-20 SQLs in first 90 days; ≤2-hour signal-to-touch SLA enforced.

**Advisory scope:** API architecture, SQL middleware design, BI dashboarding, anomaly detection.

**Outcome:** Eliminated 40-hour monthly manual reconciliation; executive visibility into portfolio performance.

### Outcome-First Repositioning
**Context:** Led narrative shift from service-based to outcome-anchored messaging across 6 business units.

**Advisory scope:** Outcome mapping, language governance, sales enablement alignment, claim validation.

**Outcome:** 10% payment lift on AI tracks; 20%+ cost reduction via digital-first positioning.

## Section 4: The Fit

**Headline:** Let's Talk If

- **You're a CEO, CRO, or VP** facing a specific GTM systems challenge, not looking for a vendor to outsource to
- **You're pre-Series B or Series B+** with product-market fit and the budget to act on recommendations
- **You need architecture, not implementation**—someone to design the system your team will execute
- **You're evaluating AI tools** and need governance frameworks, not just vendor demos
- **You want a second opinion** on positioning, org design, or demand gen strategy before committing resources

**Not a fit if:**
- You're looking for an agency to execute campaigns
- You need fractional CMO execution on an ongoing retainer
- Your primary need is creative production or brand design

---

## Section 5: How It Works

**Headline:** Engagement Structure

I keep this lightweight and high-leverage.

### Strategic Audit
**Format:** 2-week deep dive into your GTM systems, messaging, or org design
**Output:** Written assessment + 90-minute leadership presentation + prioritized recommendation roadmap
**Investment:** Custom, based on scope

### Advisory Retainer
**Format:** Monthly advisory relationship with structured touchpoints
**Scope:** 2-3 strategic sessions per month + asynchronous guidance + board prep support
**Investment:** Custom, based on scope and duration

### Board/Advisory Role
**Format:** Ongoing strategic advisor to leadership team
**Scope:** Quarterly strategy reviews + monthly operating check-ins + on-call for critical decisions
**Investment:** Equity +/or retainer, case-by-case basis

**All engagements are custom-structured.** No tiered packages. No upsells. We scope to your actual need.

## Design Notes for Implementation

### Page Location
- **URL:** `/advisory` (preferred) or `/consulting` (if legacy)
- **Nav placement:** Footer or secondary menu, NOT primary navigation
- **Cross-link:** Add subtle link from About/Career page

### Tone & Voice
- Executive peer, not vendor
- Confident but not arrogant
- Specific, not vague
- Metric-aware without being resume-dense

### Key Distinctions to Maintain
- ✓ "Advisory engagements" — NOT "Fractional CMO services"
- ✓ "Strategic guidance" — NOT "consulting solutions"
- ✓ "Custom engagements" — NOT tiered pricing ($5K/$12K/$25K)
- ✓ "While I seek my next VP role" — primary identity clear

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Context** (why advisory, not pivot)
2. **Expertise areas** (4 advisory domains)
3. **Proof points** (recent TSI examples)
4. **Qualification** (who this is for)
5. **Structure** (how engagements work)
6. **CTA** (Calendly + email)

### Copy Patterns to Avoid
- "I help businesses grow" (vague)
- "Comprehensive solutions" (vendor-speak)
- "Trusted advisor to dozens of companies" (if not true)
- "Book a discovery call" (sales-y)
- "Limited spots available" (scarcity marketing)

## Navigation Integration Brief

### Option 1: Footer Navigation (Recommended)
Add to existing footer links:
```
© 2026 CJL | Built on Trust | Advisory
```

### Option 2: Secondary Menu
If a secondary menu exists (often in header right):
```
[Work] [About] [Advisory]  |  [Email] [LinkedIn]
```

### Option 3: About Page Cross-Link
Add section at bottom of About/Career page:
```
---
**Advisory**
Selectively advising leadership teams on GTM systems and strategy. [Learn more →](/advisory)
```

### Rationale for Non-Primary Placement
- Primary identity is **VP GTM Systems seeking next role**
- Advisory is secondary, framed as "keeping sharp"
- Keeps focus on portfolio work and career positioning
- Avoids perception of being a full-time consultant
- Executive hiring managers see ambition, not vendor positioning
