# 2026-03-01 Checkpoint

**Timestamp:** 2026-03-01 03:37 AM (America/Chicago)

**Session:** Cron: Hourly checkpoint

---

## Status

❌ **Checkpoint incomplete** - Cannot access main session history from cron context (tool visibility restricted to current session tree).

## Notes

- Attempted `sessions_history` for `agent:main:main` → Access denied
- `sessions_list` shows only current cron session
- This is a security/privacy constraint, not a failure

## Action Needed

Main session checkpoint requires:
1. Running from within the main session directly, OR
2. A separate mechanism for cross-session history access

---

**04:07 AM** - Hourly checkpoint run. Session history still inaccessible from cron context (tool visibility tree-restricted). No new updates to log.
