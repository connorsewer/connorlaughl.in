# BDR Pod: Signal-to-Meeting in 2 Hours

## The Problem

TSI had reps dialing from a static list.

- No intent signals
- No prioritization logic
- No SLA between a website visit and an outbound touch

Marketing generated traffic. Sales worked a list. The gap between interest and contact was measured in days (when it was measured at all).

## Constraints

- **No new headcount / budget:** repurposed existing telesales capacity
- **SLA required:** speed is the product in this motion

## What I Built

Repurposed telesales capacity into a dedicated 2-person BDR pod. Built the operating system end-to-end:

- **Signal source:** ZoomInfo WebSights daily exports for B2B company visits to TSI properties
- **Enrichment layer:** Company match → ideal customer profile (ICP) score → contact append (before a human touches it)
- **Hard 2-hour rule:** Signal identified → first outbound touch within 2 hours (not a target)
- **DebtNext cross-sell track:** Parallel motion into existing DebtNext accounts for TSI upsell (warm pipeline from day one)
- **Weekly operating review:** Signal quality, conversion rates, and disqualification patterns—iterate weekly

## Targets (First 90 Days)

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Meetings booked | 40–60 |
| SQLs generated | 12–20 |
| Signal-to-touch SLA | ≤ 2 hours |
| Review cadence | Weekly (Friday) |

## Why This Matters at the VP+ Level

This wasn’t “we hired SDRs.” It was a resource reallocation + governance play.

I took existing telesales capacity, added an intent signal layer, enforced an SLA with teeth, and turned a cost center into a pipeline engine.

## Interview Anchor

> "I didn’t ask for new headcount. I repurposed telesales into a signal-driven BDR pod with a hard 2-hour SLA. First 90 days: 40–60 meetings and 12–20 SQLs. The unlock was governance—documented workflows and a weekly operating review loop."
